      \item [1.1] Prove $1^2+2^2+...+n^2=\dfrac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)$ for all positive integers n.\\\textbf{Answer: } By induction. \\
            Base case ($n=1$): $1=\dfrac{1}{6}(1+1)(2+1)\implies1=1$ which is true. \\
            Inductive step: Assume $1^2+2^2+...+n^2=\dfrac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)$ is true, we want to show that $1^2+2^2+...+n^2+(n+1)^2=\dfrac{1}{6}(n+1)(n+2)(2n+3)$ is true. We can do so by adding $(n+1)^2$ to both sides of the equation as follows:
            \[1^2+2^2+...+n^2+(n+1)^2=\dfrac{1}{6}n(n+1)(2n+1)+(n+1)^2\]
            Factoring out $(n+1)$ from both terms on the right hand side:
            \[1^2+2^2+...+n^2+(n+1)^2=(n+1)(\dfrac{1}{6}n(2n+1)+(n+1))\]
            \[\implies1^2+2^2+...+n^2+(n+1)^2=(n+1)(\dfrac{1}{6}n(2n+1)+(n+1))\]
      \item [1.9]
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item [(a)] Decide for which integers the inequality $2^n>n^2$ is true.
                  \item [(b)] Prove your claim in (a) by mathematical induction.
            \end{itemize}
      \item [1.11] For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $P_n$ denote the assertion "$n^2+5n+1$ is an even integer."
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item [(a)] Prove $P_{n+1}$ is true whenever $P_n$ is true.
                  \item [(b)] For which $n$ is $P_n$ actually true? What is the moral of this exercise?

      \item [P1] Write down the converse and the contrapositive of the following statement regarding a real number $x$: \[\text{If } x>0, \text{then } x^2-x>0.\] Then determine which (if any) of the three statements are true for all real numbers $x$.\\
            \textbf{Answer: } Converse: if $x^2-x>0$, then $x>0$, which is false by counterexample $x=-1$. Contrapositive: if $x^2-x\leq0$, then $x\leq0$, which is false by counterexample $x=1$.
      \item [P2] Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is not rational.\\
            \textbf{Answer: } By contradiction. Suppose $\sqrt{3}$ is rational, then by definition of rational numbers, there must exist $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\dfrac{p}{q}=\sqrt{3}$, where $p,q$ have no common factors upon simplying. Then, we also have $\dfrac{p^2}{q^2}=3\implies p^2=3q^2$. Since $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}$ and by extension $p^2,q^2\in\mathbb{Z}$, $p^2\mid 3$. Additionally, $p\mid 3$ because $\sqrt{3}\notin\mathbb{Z}$. Then, $p^2\mid 9$. By substituting $p^2=3q^2$, we now have $3q^2\mid 9\implies q^2\mid 3$, implying $q\mid 3$ by previous logic. Then $p,q$ have common factor $3$ whcih contradicts with our initial assumption. Therefore $\sqrt{3}$ is not rational.
